    <h3>G0 V</h3>
    <p>
      The G0 V star is a Yellow Dwarf star with 6 planets in its orbit. It has a
      mass of approximately 0.97819 M, a luminosity of approximately 0.93256,
      and a temperature of approximately 5756.85 C or 10394.33 F.
    </p>

    <p>
      G0 V stars, also known as yellow dwarfs, are a common type of
      main-sequence star found in the universe. They fall under the spectral
      classification of G0, indicating a moderate surface temperature and a
      significant emission of visible light. Similar to our Sun, G0 V stars are
      relatively stable, generating energy through nuclear fusion in their
      cores. This process involves the combination of hydrogen atoms to form
      helium, releasing vast amounts of energy. G0 V stars share similarities
      with our Sun in terms of size, mass, and temperature, though they are
      slightly hotter and brighter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The study of G0 V stars is of great interest to astronomers due to their
      potential as hosts for exoplanets and the possibility of supporting life.
      These stars provide valuable insights into stellar evolution and the
      potential for habitable worlds. Investigating G0 V stars and their
      planetary systems allows scientists to deepen their understanding of the
      conditions necessary for the development and sustainability of life beyond
      our own planet.

    <h3>Aetheria Prime</h3>
    <p>
      The average day on Aetheria Prime, also known as HIP 184131, It has 14
      days a year and has a mass of around 0.2624 million tons with a
      temperature of about 462.56 degrees Celsius and 864.608 degrees
      Fahrenheit. This planet has been around for 10 years and has 5 moons,
      including Luminaire-1 or HIP 18413 1.1. The other 4 moons are asteroids.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aetheria Prime is a captivating planet that stands out with its peculiar
      green atmosphere, creating an otherworldly appearance. The entire planet
      is blanketed in a mesmerizing greenish glow, a result of various gases and
      particulates present in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is alive with
      shimmering bands of energy, producing a surreal and ethereal display that
      enchants observers. Diverging from Jupiter, Aetheria Prime is a searing
      world of extreme heat. Its surface is constantly shaped by intense
      volcanic activity, where molten rock flows as rivers and towering plumes
      of steam and gas erupt into the air. The planet's expansive rocky plains
      are interrupted by bubbling hot springs and geothermal vents, adding to
      its distinctive features.

    <p>
      The eerie and alien light cast by the green atmospheric haze intensifies
      the planet's mysterious allure. Occasional bursts of electrical discharges
      crackle within the clouds, resulting in flickering flashes of green
      lightning that illuminate the sky. Aetheria Prime's climate is
      characterized by turbulent and powerful storms raging across its surface,
      driven by the intense heat and atmospheric dynamics. Fierce winds roar
      through jagged canyons and gorges, creating an echoing howl that
      reverberates throughout the planet. Overall, Aetheria Prime presents a
      visually striking yet inhospitable world, with its enigmatic green
      atmosphere and scorching temperatures. While bearing some resemblance to
      Jupiter, it possesses unique and captivating qualities that set it apart.
